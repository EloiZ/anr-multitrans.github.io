For robots to successfully perform assigned tasks in uncontrolled environments, having a perception system that can provide information beyond encountered scenarios is crucial. Object detection model generates a large number of object proposals that we filter to obtain the best detections. However, there is still valuable information within unselected proposals. To make this information available for other systems, a first approach could be to use the scores from the model architecture. Those valuable insights can be use to make more informed decisions for controlling robots.
